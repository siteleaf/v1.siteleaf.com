We’re currently hard at work on version 2 of Siteleaf, which brings a bunch of new features and improvements that we’re eager to show off. We’ve taken everything you love about v1 and made it more open, more customizable, and easier to develop.

For a tour of the new features, check out [v2.siteleaf.com](http://v2.siteleaf.com).

While we wrap things up, we’re also inviting a small batch of good people to try things out and provide feedback. If you are interesting, [sign up to join the beta](https://siteleaf.typeform.com/to/EoFRli).
