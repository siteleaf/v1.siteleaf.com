All paid Siteleaf plans come with a free built-in option for hosting your website. With Siteleaf Hosting you can choose a subdomain (e.g. `yourname.siteleaf.net`) or use your custom domain name.

### Benefits
Siteleaf Hosting is powered by a content delivery network (CDN), with edge locations around the world. Your site will serve up lightning fast just about everywhere.

### Limitations
With Siteleaf Hosting, your published changes can take up to 15 minutes to propogate throughout the CDN. 

Custom domains must use a `CNAME` record (not an `A` record), this typically means using a subdomain like `www.example.com` instead of `example.com`. For more, see [using custom domains](/help/hosting/siteleaf/custom-domains).
