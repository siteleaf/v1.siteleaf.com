**What's the deal with the free developer plan?**

Our free developer plan is simply a way to have unlimited access to (almost) all of Siteleaf's features. The one limitation of the free developer account is that publishing is disabled, this requires one of our paid plans.

**I just published my site to Siteleaf Hosting but not seeing the changes yet.**

There's typically a 15 minute delay between publishing your site to Siteleaf Hosting and the changes propagating across our CDN. It's our goal to make this instantaneous in the future.
