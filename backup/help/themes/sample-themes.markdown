Our [themes GitHub repo](https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-themes) contains the default Siteleaf theme as well as a basic barebones template to help you get started. 

[More sample themes can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-themes/wiki/Siteleaf-themes-on-Github). If you have a theme you'd like to share with the community, feel free to add it.
